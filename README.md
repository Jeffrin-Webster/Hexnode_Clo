# Project Name

## Features Implemented

- **Tabs**: Created a responsive tab component allowing easy navigation between different sections.
- **Carousel**: Implemented a dynamic carousel for image or content display.
- **Other Components**: Input, Date, Card.

## Approach

### Technologies Used:
- **React.js**: For creating interactive and reusable components.
- **React Router**: For navigation between different views (if applicable).
- **CSS / SCSS**: For styling, with Flexbox and Grid for responsive layouts.
- **JavaScript (ES6+ features)**: For writing logic and handling events.
- **React Hooks**: For managing state and side effects in functional components.
- **Styled-components**: For styling.
- Ensured mobile responsiveness using media queries.
- Focused on modular and reusable components.
- Used semantic HTML for better accessibility.

### Challenges Faced:
- Implementing the tabs and carousel components required additional research. Finding the right libraries for smooth transitions and ensuring cross-browser compatibility took more time than initially anticipated.
- Optimizing the performance of the carousel for faster loading times and smoother animations.

### Additional Notes:
Given more time, I would refine the design and add extra features like accessibility improvements, form validation, and advanced animations.
Iâ€™ve ensured that the components are flexible and can be reused in different parts of the application.
